## Tracking signal's frequency dataset generator

This package helps to easily generate a dataset to study the "tracking of a signal's frequency.  
It includes both the modeling and simulation of a generator to create dataset 
with pseudo-random sequences. For each sequence, three quantities by signal are given :  
- Phase
- Frequency. 
- Derivative of frequency.

This code has a research purpose.
